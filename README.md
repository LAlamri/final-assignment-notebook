# Data Science Final Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the final project for the Data Science course. In this notebook, I demonstrate my ability to use various data science tools, including Jupyterlite and GitHub for collaboration and sharing.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to:
- Learn how to use Jupyterlite for writing and sharing data science projects.
- Demonstrate skills in using Python for arithmetic operations, data visualization, and applying machine learning libraries.
- Share the notebook through GitHub for peer review.
